        <p >
          I grew up with both Superman and Batman being two of three of the first superheroes I was ever introduced to.
          They hold a special place in my life and have always enjoyed any content they where apart of, be it comics, cartoon
          series, or movies. Most of the time these allies are pitted against each other in the shows, usually when they are first 
          introduced to each other and mind control is usually a factor. They fight remove the mind control and team up to save the day.
          In other cases, such as online debates, they are pitted against each other in a fight to the death. Even though they are allies, 
          powerful in their own ways, people will always want to know who is more powerful by having them try and kill each other. This usaully 
          irritates me because not only are they allies, but they are also great friends. If I were to be asked this question, as much as it 
          may irritate me, I have to go with Superman this isn't because of his powers or because he has become the real underdog since the 
          Christopher Nolan trilogy. This is because I have narrowed it down to one simple question; would you rather have The Most Dangerous Man 
          on Earth kill Eath's Last Hope or Eath's Last Hope kill The Most Dangerous Man on Earth?
